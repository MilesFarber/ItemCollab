You can make footnotes with a caret and a number, between square brackets[^1].
You can also use whatever name you want instead of a number.[^Name]

[^1]: Add a colon (NOT semicolon) to invoke the footnote, make sure it's at the bottom of the page and at the beginning of the line or it won't work.
[^Name]: Although it will still display as a number with certain themes.
